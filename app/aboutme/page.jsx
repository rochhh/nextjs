          I've been Coding since my 1st year in Uni and have developed interest in Software Engineering and Data Science.
          These topics fascinate me and I love researching more about them.
          I was able to clear the AWS certified developer cloud associate exam in my FIRST attempt and now I am officially AWS certified developer associate
          I was also the lead coordinator of Economics Industry Project , where i managed all students as well as communicated with different clients , which gave me insights on how real-world projects take place .
